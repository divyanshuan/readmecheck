   <ol>
      <li>
        Write a program to read a matrix of size m & n form the keyboard and
        display the same using function.
      </li>
      <li>Program to make the use of inline function</li>
      <li>
        Write a function power which raises a number m to a power n. The
        function takes a double value of m and integer value of n and returns
        the result. Use a default value of n is 2 to make the function to
        calculate squares when this argument is omitted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Program to show that the effect of default arguments can be
        alternatively achieved by overloading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a class ACCOUNT that represents your bank account and then use it.
        The class should allow you to deposit money, withdraw money, calculate
        interest,and send you a message if you have insufficient balance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a class STRING that can be used to store strings, add strings,
        equate string, output strings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the class TIMI: to store time in hours and minutes. Write a
        friend function to add two TIME: objects
      </li>
      <li>
        Create two classes DM and DIB. DM stores the distance in meter and
        centimeters and DB stores the distance in feet and inches. Write a
        program two add object of DM with the object of DB class.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an
        empty method named number Of Sides ( ).Provide three classes named
        Trapezoid, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes
        inherits the class Shape. Fach one of the classes contains only the
        method number Of Sides ( ) that shows the number of sides in the given
        geometrical figures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Program to demonstrate the concept of:
        <ul>
          <li>Default constructor</li>
          <li>Parameterized constructor</li>
          <li>Copy constructor</li>
          <li>Constructor overloading</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Program to demonstrate the concept of destructor.</li>
      <li>Program to show multiple inheritance</li>
      <li>Program to show multilevel inheritance</li>
      <li>Program to show hybrid inheritance</li>
      <li>Program to show the concept of containership.</li>
      <li>Program to overload unary operator.</li>
      <li>Program to overload binary operator</li>
      <li>
        Program to show the concept of run time polymorphism using virtual
        functions.
      </li>
      <li>Program to work with formatted and unformatted I0 operations.</li>
      <li>
        Program to read the name and roll numbers of students from keyboard and
        write them into a file and then display it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Program to copy one file onto the end of another, adding line numbers
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a function template for finding the minimum value contained in an
        array.
      </li>
    </ol>
